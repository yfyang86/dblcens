Description: Use EM algorithm to compute the NPMLE of CDF and also the
        two censoring distributions. For doubly censored data (as
        described in Chang and Yang (1987) Ann. Stat. 1536-47). You can
        also specify a constraint, it will return the constrained NPMLE
        and the -2 log empirical likelihood ratio. This can be used to
        test the hypothesis about the constraint and find confidence
        intervals for probability or quantile via empirical likelihood
        ratio theorem. Influence function of hat F may also be
        calculated (but may be slow).
